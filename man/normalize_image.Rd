\title{Normalize Image Based on the Peak}
\usage{
normalize_image(vol, contrast = c("T1", "PD", "T2", "FLAIR", "FL"),
  verbose = TRUE, gridsize = 128)

image_peak(vol, contrast = c("T1", "PD", "T2", "FLAIR", "FL"),
  verbose = TRUE, gridsize = 128)

flexconn_image_peak(vol, contrast = c("T1", "PD", "T2", "FLAIR", "FL"),
  verbose = TRUE, gridsize = 80L)
}
\arguments{
\item{vol}{3D array or \code{nifti} image}

\item{contrast}{What imaging sequence of MRI is this volume}

\item{verbose}{print diagnostic messages}

\item{gridsize}{Grid size to use kernel density estiamtion.
Passed to \code{\link[KernSmooth]{bkde}}}
}
\value{
The peak of the image is returned for \code{image_peak}
and the normalized image in \code{normalize_image}
}
